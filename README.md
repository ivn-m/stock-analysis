# Stock Analysis

##Overview of Project
###Purpose
The purpose of this analysis using VBA in Excel was to refactor the Module 2 solution code to loop through all of the data found in the VBA_Challenge.xlsm file and test if the refactored code allows the analysis process to be done at a faster rate and/or with less computational memory.

##Results
###The following steps were completed on the refactored code.

1. Created tickerIndex variable and set it equal to zero before iterating aover all rows.
